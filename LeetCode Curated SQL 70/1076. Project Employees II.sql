-- solution 1
Declare @count numeric
select top 1
    @count = count(project_id)
from project p
group by p.project_id
order by count(project_id) desc

select project_id
from project p
group by project_id
having count(project_id) = @count


-- solution 2

select
    p.project_id
from project p
group by p.project_id
having count(p.project_id) = (
    select top 1
        count(p1.project_id)
    from project p1
    group by p1.project_id
    order by count(p1.project_id) desc
)
